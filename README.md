# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis  
🚀 A data-driven analysis to identify key factors influencing hotel cancellations and provide actionable recommendations to optimize revenue and operational efficiency.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations using **Python** and **data visualization techniques**. It explores how factors like **pricing, booking sources, and seasonality** impact cancellation rates and provides strategies to minimize revenue loss.  

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
City and Resort Hotels are experiencing **high cancellation rates**, leading to:  
- Revenue losses due to unoccupied rooms.  
- Inefficient room utilization and operational challenges.  
- Increased dependency on third-party booking platforms.  

## 🔹 Hypotheses Tested  
✅ **Higher prices lead to more cancellations.**  
✅ **Longer waiting lists result in increased cancellations.**  
✅ **Most bookings come from online travel agents (OTAs), leading to higher cancellation rates.**  

## 🔹 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn) for data analysis & visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for executing and visualizing the analysis.  
- **Excel** for initial data processing and hypothesis testing.  

## 📊 Key Insights from Analysis  
1️⃣ **August has the highest bookings & cancellations, while January sees the most cancellations.**  
2️⃣ **City hotels have higher demand compared to resort hotels.**  
3️⃣ **46% of bookings are made via online travel agencies (OTAs), leading to more cancellations.**  
4️⃣ **Portugal has the highest number of cancellations.**  

## 📌 Recommendations  
✅ **Dynamic Pricing Strategy** – Adjust room rates based on demand patterns to reduce price-driven cancellations.  
✅ **Weekend & Holiday Discounts** – Lower prices during off-peak periods to encourage confirmed bookings.  
✅ **Targeted Marketing** – Run promotional campaigns in January to reduce cancellations.  
✅ **Improve Customer Experience** – Enhance service quality, especially in Portugal, to increase guest retention.
